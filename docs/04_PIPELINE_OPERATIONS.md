# 04 — Pipeline Operations

The day-to-day procedure for running the pipeline on a sized instance. Assumes you've completed [`02_INFRASTRUCTURE_SETUP.md`](02_INFRASTRUCTURE_SETUP.md) and [`03_SIZING_AND_RESIZING_GUIDE.md`](03_SIZING_AND_RESIZING_GUIDE.md) — that is, your instance is provisioned and (if needed) sized for your data.

**As of orchestrator v0.7.4 (June 2026)**, the entire pipeline is driven by a single PowerShell script — `powershell/Run-Pipeline.ps1` — that handles all five phases (Split → Detect → CFU → Consolidate → Upload), per-run audit trails, three-stage stall detection, and resume guards. This document is structured around that orchestrator.

If you need to run the underlying scripts manually (debugging an opaque failure, redistributing pathological files, or testing with non-standard inputs), see [Appendix Z](#appendix-z-manual-workflow-pre-v07-or-debugging) for the manual workflow. For >95% of routine runs, **you only need sections A–E**.

## A. Pre-flight

### A.1 — One-time per session setup

Open PowerShell on the EC2 instance. Set execution policy for this window (allows running the orchestrator script without re-signing):

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
```

Tune AWS CLI for fast parallel transfers (one-time per instance, persists):

```powershell
aws configure set default.s3.max_concurrent_requests 40
aws configure set default.s3.max_queue_size 10000
```

### A.2 — Pull the latest orchestrator

```powershell
cd C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\pipeline-repo
git pull
git describe --tags
# Should show v0.7.4 or later
```

### A.3 — Verify the stack

```powershell
# Worker exes present and recent
Test-Path C:\AQuA2\compiled\aqua_lane.exe
Test-Path C:\AQuA2\compiled\cfu_lane.exe
(Get-Item C:\AQuA2\compiled\aqua_lane.exe).LastWriteTime
(Get-Item C:\AQuA2\compiled\cfu_lane.exe).LastWriteTime

# AQuA2 parameter CSV present
Test-Path C:\AQuA2\cfg\parameters_for_batch.csv

# AWS auth via IAM role
aws sts get-caller-identity   # should return your account ID and assumed-role ARN

# Free disk
Get-Volume C | Select-Object @{N='UsedGB';E={[math]::Round(($_.Size-$_.SizeRemaining)/1GB,1)}}, @{N='FreeGB';E={[math]::Round($_.SizeRemaining/1GB,1)}}
```

If any check fails, see [`02_INFRASTRUCTURE_SETUP.md`](02_INFRASTRUCTURE_SETUP.md) Part H.

### A.4 — Confirm the input TIFFs are accessible

Before launching the orchestrator, place your input TIFFs in a single directory. Most users either:

- Pull from S3:

  ```powershell
  mkdir D:\incoming_tiffs
  aws s3 sync s3://<your-bucket>/CalciumImagingTIFFs/<dataset>/TRIMMED/ D:\incoming_tiffs\
  ```

- Already have TIFFs on the EBS volume from a previous step.

Quick count:

```powershell
$count = (Get-ChildItem D:\incoming_tiffs -Filter *.tif).Count
$totalGB = [math]::Round(((Get-ChildItem D:\incoming_tiffs -Filter *.tif | Measure-Object -Property Length -Sum).Sum / 1GB), 2)
"Input TIFFs: $count files, $totalGB GB total"
```

---

## B. The orchestrator at a glance

`Run-Pipeline.ps1` drives five sequential phases. Each can be toggled on/off independently. By default, Split + Detect + CFU run; Consolidate and Upload are off (Consolidate auto-enables if you set `-Upload $true`).

| # | Phase | What it does | Output |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | **Auto-Size** (implicit) | Probes the largest input TIFF; computes safe lane count for the instance's RAM. Skipped if `-Lanes` is explicitly set. | (selects lane count) |
| 1 | **Split** | Moves TIFFs from `-InputTIFFs` into `<projectRoot>\lanes\laneNN\` folders, size-balanced. | `<projectRoot>\lanes\laneNN\*.tif` |
| 2 | **Detect** | Launches N `aqua_lane.exe` workers in parallel, each processes its lane's TIFFs. | `<projectRoot>\PreCFU\laneNN_results\<stem>_AQuA2.mat` (+ siblings) |
| 3 | **CFU** | Launches M `cfu_lane.exe` workers (~0.75 × N by default) over detected `.mat` files via NTFS junctions. Bakes CFU fields into the original `.mat` AND writes a standalone `_res_cfu.mat`. | `<projectRoot>\PostCFU\<stem>_AQuA2_res_cfu.mat` |
| 4 | **Consolidate** | Builds `<projectRoot>\for_upload\` with `input_TIFFs/`, `PreCFU/` (per-stem), `PostCFU/` (flat). Uses **NTFS hardlinks** — zero extra disk cost. | `<projectRoot>\for_upload\` |
| 5 | **Upload** | `aws s3 sync` of `for_upload/` to the S3 prefix you specify. | (files in S3) |

> **What `Run-Pipeline.ps1` replaced.** Pre-v0.7, you ran `Split-IntoLanes.ps1` → `Launch-Lanes-Exe.ps1` → `Build-CFU-Lanes.ps1` → `Launch-CFU-Lanes.ps1` → `Consolidate-Template.ps1` → `aws s3 sync` by hand, with manual stuck-lane recovery between phases. v0.7.4 collapses all of this into one command with built-in resume, audit trails, and stall handling. The old scripts still exist in `powershell/` for the cases in [Appendix Z](#appendix-z-manual-workflow-pre-v07-or-debugging).

### Project root layout

## C. Set parameters

The orchestrator does not modify parameters — it reads them from the AQuA2 CSV at runtime. **Edit the CSV before launching**.

### C.1 — Edit `parameters_for_batch.csv`

Open `C:\AQuA2\cfg\parameters_for_batch.csv` in Notepad. The format is multi-column: rows are parameters, columns `File1`...`File12` are preset slots. **The active preset is `File1`.** All other columns are alternative presets you can swap in by editing the script (rarely needed).

Critical rows to confirm before every run:

| Variable | Typical | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `frameRate` | `0.05` for 20 Hz, `0.1` for 10 Hz | seconds/frame. **NOT** auto-detected from filename. If your dataset mixes frame rates, run as separate batches. |
| `spatialRes` | `1.3` for 20x, `2.6` for 10x | µm/pixel. Verify on your microscope. |
| `maxSize` | varies by dataset | hCO/FOXP1 typically 400; assembloids typically 50000. **Document your choice** in the run README so the S3 prefix naming and the data tell the same story. |
| `detectGlo` | `0` (off) | Set to `1` to compute global signal events. Adds 2 extra output files per recording (`_Glo_Ch1.xlsx`, `_Glo_Ch1_curves.xlsx`). |

Other parameters: leave at AQuA2 defaults (`minSize=20`, `thrARScl=2`, `minDur=3`, `sourceSensitivity=9`, `regMaskGap=1`, etc.) unless you have a specific reason to change them.

> **Why not different parameters per file?** The pipeline applies the same File1 column to every file in a batch. If a subset needs different parameters, run them as a separate batch with a different `-ProjectName`. Mixed parameters within a single run are a documentation and reproducibility hazard.

### C.2 — Check CFU parameters (rarely changed)

CFU parameters are **compiled into `cfu_lane.exe`**, not read from a CSV. Current values are documented at `C:\AQuA2\cfg\cfu_parameters_BAKED.txt`:

```
overlapThr1 = 0.5    overlapThr2 = 0.5
minNumEvt1 = 3       minNumEvt2 = 3
maxDist = 10
pValueThr = 1e-5
cfuNumThr = 3
```

Changing these requires editing `C:\AQuA2\cfu_lane.m`, recompiling `cfu_lane.exe`, **and** updating `cfu_parameters_BAKED.txt`. This is a maintainer task — see the comment block at the top of `cfu_parameters_BAKED.txt`.

---

## D. Dry-run preview (always do this first)

Before launching anything that will run for hours, do a dry-run preview. The orchestrator's `-WhatIfMode` flag prints the full plan summary and exits without executing.

```powershell
cd C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\pipeline-repo\powershell

.\Run-Pipeline.ps1 `
    -OutputRoot "D:\runs" `
    -ProjectName "my_dataset_2026-06-15" `
    -InputTIFFs  "D:\incoming_tiffs" `
    -WhatIfMode
```

You'll see:

- **Project paths**: where outputs and logs will land
- **Pre-flight check results**: are the scripts and `.exe`s where they should be, is disk sufficient, etc.
- **Plan summary**: which phases will run, input file count, lane count (auto-sized or specified)
- **Resume context**: how many `.mat` files already exist in `PreCFU` and `PostCFU` (these will be skipped by per-file guards)
- **Active parameter values** from `parameters_for_batch.csv` — specifically the File1 column, with `detectGlo` highlighted yellow (OFF) or green (ON)
- **Stall thresholds**: 30 min warn / 45 min escalate / 60 min auto-skip (defaults)
- **Free disk**

Read this carefully. The most common errors caught at this stage:

- Wrong `detectGlo` value (yellow when you wanted green or vice versa)
- Wrong `frameRate` (defaults to a value that doesn't match your data)
- Insufficient disk space for projected outputs

Fix issues, then re-run dry-run until it looks right.

---

## E. Run the pipeline

After a clean dry-run, drop the `-WhatIfMode` flag:

### E.1 — Full pipeline including S3 upload (most common)

```powershell
.\Run-Pipeline.ps1 `
    -OutputRoot "D:\runs" `
    -ProjectName "my_dataset_2026-06-15" `
    -InputTIFFs  "D:\incoming_tiffs" `
    -Upload      $true `
    -S3Prefix    "s3://bireylab-arvin-us-east-2/CalciumImagingAnalysis/AQuA2_Outputs/my_dataset_2026-06-15/"
```

`-Upload $true` auto-enables Consolidate (`-Consolidate $true`) because the upload reads from `for_upload/`.

You'll see a confirmation prompt: `Proceed? [Y/n]`. Press **Y** to launch. To skip the prompt for unattended runs, add `-Force`.

### E.2 — Pipeline without S3 upload

If you want to inspect outputs locally before uploading:

```powershell
.\Run-Pipeline.ps1 `
    -OutputRoot "D:\runs" `
    -ProjectName "my_dataset_2026-06-15" `
    -InputTIFFs  "D:\incoming_tiffs"
# Defaults: Split=$true, Detect=$true, CFU=$true, Consolidate=$false, Upload=$false
```

### E.3 — Run a subset of phases

Each phase has an explicit on/off flag (`-Split`, `-Detect`, `-CFU`, `-Consolidate`, `-Upload`). Use these to re-do or skip phases.

Detection only (skip CFU and everything after):

```powershell
.\Run-Pipeline.ps1 `
    -OutputRoot "D:\runs" `
    -ProjectName "my_dataset_2026-06-15" `
    -InputTIFFs  "D:\incoming_tiffs" `
    -CFU         $false
```

Re-run CFU only (e.g., after fixing CFU parameters and recompiling `cfu_lane.exe`):

```powershell
.\Run-Pipeline.ps1 `
    -OutputRoot "D:\runs" `
    -ProjectName "my_dataset_2026-06-15" `
    -Split       $false `
    -Detect      $false `
    -CFU         $true `
    -Consolidate $false
```

> **Important about `-Split`**: this phase MOVES files from `-InputTIFFs` into lane folders. **On resume runs, always set `-Split $false`** — re-splitting an already-split tree is destructive. The orchestrator derives the lane count from existing folders when Split is off.

### E.4 — Run a subset of files (after a failure)

The orchestrator's per-file resume guards make subset-runs automatic: just re-run the same command, and files with existing `.mat` outputs are skipped. No need to manually move "done" files aside.

To process only specific files: move the un-wanted ones out of `D:\incoming_tiffs\` before running, OR run a fresh project with a different `-ProjectName`.

### E.5 — Common parameter combinations

| Scenario | Flags |
|---|---|
| First run on a fresh dataset, upload to S3 | (defaults) + `-Upload $true -S3Prefix "..."` |
| First run, inspect locally before uploading | (defaults), then later `aws s3 sync` manually |
| Resume after stall/crash | Same exact command as before. Resume guards handle it. |
| Re-do CFU only | `-Split $false -Detect $false` |
| Re-do Consolidate + Upload only | `-Split $false -Detect $false -CFU $false -Consolidate $true -Upload $true -S3Prefix "..."` |
| Dry-run preview | Add `-WhatIfMode` |
| Skip the proceed prompt | Add `-Force` |

---

## F. Monitor a running job

### F.1 — Status line every 60 seconds

```
[20:15:25]   23/100   23.0% |  4.5 f/min | ETA 0:17:12 | workers 32/32 | RAM 312.8GB | Disk  198GB | fail 0
```

Reads left to right: timestamp, files done/total, percent, throughput (recent window), ETA, workers alive, RAM in use, free disk, fail count.

### F.2 — Detailed snapshot every 5 minutes

```
--- Detailed snapshot @ 20:22:26 ---
Elapsed: 00:10:15
Throughput (recent window): 2.3 files/min
Workers alive: 31/32
Per-lane progress:
  lane01: 3 (0.2 min since last completion) [ALIVE]
    | Elapsed time is 21.127850 seconds.
    | Refining
  lane02: 4 (1.1 min since last completion) [ALIVE]
    | Active region detection...
  lane03: 2 (5.2 min since last completion) [ALIVE]
    | Spatial segmentation...
  ...
```

The `[ALIVE]` / `[gone ]` marker shows whether each lane's worker process is still running. A completed lane normally has `[gone ]` and a "minutes since last completion" matching how long ago it finished.

### F.3 — Watch a specific lane's log live

In a **separate** PowerShell window (don't touch the orchestrator's window):

```powershell
$proj = "D:\runs\my_dataset_2026-06-15"
Get-Content "$proj\PreCFU\_lane_logs\lane14.log" -Tail 30 -Wait
```

Ctrl+C to stop watching (won't affect the run).

### F.4 — Quick external status from another window

```powershell
$proj = "D:\runs\my_dataset_2026-06-15"
$inputs   = (Get-ChildItem "$proj\lanes" -Recurse -Filter *.tif | Where-Object { $_.Directory.FullName -notmatch '_stalled' }).Count
$detected = (Get-ChildItem "$proj\PreCFU" -Recurse -Filter *_AQuA2.mat).Count
$cfu      = (Get-ChildItem "$proj\PostCFU" -Recurse -Filter *_res_cfu.mat -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue).Count
$alive    = (Get-Process aqua_lane,cfu_lane -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Measure-Object).Count
"Input: $inputs | Detected: $detected | CFU: $cfu | Workers alive: $alive"
```

### F.5 — Free disk during a run

```powershell
Get-PSDrive C, D | Select Name, @{n='FreeGB';e={[math]::Round($_.Free/1GB,1)}}
```

If free disk on the volume holding `<projectRoot>` drops below `-MinFreeDiskGB` (default 50 GB), the orchestrator aborts the current phase. Move data off the instance or expand the volume.

---

## G. Three-stage stall detection

If a lane stops making progress on its current file, the orchestrator escalates through three stages. Defaults are warn=30 / escalate=45 / auto-skip=60 minutes.

### Stage 1: WARN (yellow)

At 30 min of no progress for a lane:

```
[WARN] [STALL WARN] lane14 (PID 9876) has made no progress for 30.0 min
[WARN]   Last lines from lane14 log:
[WARN]     Watershed grow
[WARN]     Elapsed time is 234.715128 seconds.
[WARN]     Majority
```

Heads-up only — no destructive action. You can intervene manually if you want to abort the file earlier than 60 min:

```powershell
Stop-Process -Id 9876 -Force
```

### Stage 2: ESCALATE (red)

At 45 min:

```
================================================================
 [STALL ESCALATED] lane14 (PID 9876) stalled 45.2 min
================================================================
  Last 10 lines from lane14 log:
    ...
  Auto-skip will fire in 14.8 more minutes (at 60 min total)
  To intervene manually:
    Stop-Process -Id 9876 -Force
```

Still no destructive action. Last chance to inspect and decide before auto-skip.

### Stage 3: AUTO-SKIP (default policy)

At 60 min:

```
[WARN] [STALL AUTO-SKIP] lane14 stalled for 60.1 min -- moving stuck file aside and restarting
```

The orchestrator:

1. Finds the stuck TIFF (the one in `lanes\lane14\` without a matching `_AQuA2.mat` anywhere in `PreCFU\`)
2. Moves it to `lanes\lane14\_stalled\<stem>.tif`
3. Writes a marker to `<projectRoot>\_logs\run_<ts>\stall_log.txt`
4. Kills the worker
5. Relaunches a new worker on the remaining files in the lane

### Customizing the thresholds

```powershell
# Tighter (smaller files, lower patience)
.\Run-Pipeline.ps1 ... -StallWarnMin 15 -StallEscalateMin 25 -StallAutoSkipMin 40

# More patient (very large files, slow but legitimate processing)
.\Run-Pipeline.ps1 ... -StallWarnMin 45 -StallEscalateMin 75 -StallAutoSkipMin 120

# Warn only, never auto-skip (manual control)
.\Run-Pipeline.ps1 ... -StallPolicy warn-only
```

### Handling stalled files after a run

After the run, check for stalled files:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem "<projectRoot>\lanes\*\_stalled" -Filter *.tif -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Get-Content "<projectRoot>\_logs\run_*\stall_log.txt" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

Decisions:

- **Try lower `maxSize`**: move the stalled file to a fresh InputTIFFs folder, edit the CSV to a smaller `maxSize` (e.g., 2000), run a single-file batch. Document the parameter difference in your README.
- **Exclude**: leave the file in `_stalled\`, document the exclusion. With N >> 1, a single exclusion rarely affects statistics.

---

## H. Resume after interruption

Anything that interrupts a run — Ctrl+C, network drop, instance reboot, auto-skip — is safe. Re-run the same command:

```powershell
.\Run-Pipeline.ps1 `
    -OutputRoot  "D:\runs" `
    -ProjectName "my_dataset_2026-06-15" `
    -InputTIFFs  "D:\incoming_tiffs" `
    -Split       $false `
    -Upload      $true `
    -S3Prefix    "s3://bireylab-arvin-us-east-2/CalciumImagingAnalysis/AQuA2_Outputs/my_dataset_2026-06-15/"
```

**Always set `-Split $false` on resume** — see [E.3](#e3--run-a-subset-of-phases).

The dry-run-style plan summary at the top of each run shows:

```
Detection .mat files:  64  (will be skipped by per-file resume guard)
CFU .mat files:        62  (will be skipped by per-file resume guard)
```

So you can see exactly where you're resuming from.

A new audit subfolder `_logs\run_<new_timestamp>\` is created for each resume — old audit folders are not modified. To reconstruct the full history of a project, list `_logs\run_*\RUN_SUMMARY.md` in order.

---

## I. Recovering from failures

### I.1 — A single file fails

If a file throws a MATLAB exception, the worker writes `<projectRoot>\_logs\run_<ts>\failures\<stem>_ERROR.txt` with the full stack trace and moves on. The orchestrator counts it in the `fail` column of the status line.

Open the `_ERROR.txt` to diagnose. Common causes:

- **Corrupt TIFF** — re-export from Fiji.
- **TIFF too short (<50 frames)** — trim wasn't applied; rerun the trim macro.
- **Out-of-memory** — the file is unusually large; either process it solo on a bigger instance, or lower `maxSize` for that file in a single-file batch.
- **Anomalously high event count** — AQuA2's feature extraction can run out of memory on pathological event counts. Carol FOXP1 lanes 05 and 30 in May 2026 hit this; flag for manual review.
- **Bad cfg path** — the worker can't find `parameters_for_batch.csv`. Confirm it's at `C:\AQuA2\cfg\` and the orchestrator's `-ConfigCSV` resolves to it.

### I.2 — An entire lane errors out at startup

If `<projectRoot>\PreCFU\_lane_logs\laneNN.err` has content (`Length > 0`), the lane's worker failed before processing any file. Open the `.err` to see the error. Common causes:

- Path with spaces/quoting issue in the launcher
- MATLAB Runtime not installed (or wrong version)
- Permission denied on output folder

After fixing, re-run the same orchestrator command — the lane's resume guards handle the relaunch.

### I.3 — Many files fail with the same error

Usually a parameter problem. Check the archived `parameters_for_batch_USED.csv` in the audit folder against what you intended. If `maxSize` is wrong, fix the CSV and re-run; the resume guards skip already-done files.

### I.4 — Detailed pitfall guide

For comprehensive recovery patterns (corrupted `.mat`, network drops mid-S3-sync, instance reboots during long runs, Bug class 9 / "instant return" S3 sync, etc.), see [`06_PITFALLS_AND_RECOVERY.md`](06_PITFALLS_AND_RECOVERY.md).

---

## J. The per-run audit trail

Every run creates `<projectRoot>\_logs\run_<timestamp>\` with the following files. These are your **single source of truth** for what happened, with what parameters, on what code version.

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `pipeline.log` | Full orchestrator transcript (everything printed to the console) |
| `RUN_SUMMARY.md` | Human-readable summary: phases run, durations, file counts, failures |
| `run_manifest.json` | Machine-readable manifest: orchestrator version, worker .exe LastWriteTime, parameter checksums, timing |
| `parameters_for_batch_USED.csv` | Exact copy of the AQuA2 CSV active at runtime |
| `cfu_parameters_BAKED.txt` | Documented CFU parameters compiled into `cfu_lane.exe` |
| `PHASE_<N>_<NAME>_COMPLETE.txt` | One marker per completed phase, with timestamp |
| `per_file_status_detect.csv` | One row per file: status (DONE/FAILED/STALLED), worker PID, duration |
| `per_file_status_cfu.csv` | Same for CFU phase |
| `stall_log.txt` | All WARN/ESCALATED/AUTO-SKIP events with timestamps |
| `failures\<stem>_ERROR.txt` | One file per failure with full error trace |

**Keep these.** When the audit folder is uploaded to S3 alongside the data, future analysis can always recover which parameters produced which `.mat`. Without it, a downstream surprise (unexpected event counts, missing fields, etc.) is much harder to debug.

The orchestrator does not delete old run folders. After many runs, prune the oldest:

```powershell
# Keep the 5 newest run folders, delete the rest
Get-ChildItem "<projectRoot>\_logs" -Directory -Filter "run_*" |
    Sort-Object LastWriteTime -Descending |
    Select-Object -Skip 5 |
    Remove-Item -Recurse -Force
```

---

## K. Verifying completion

When the orchestrator says "All phases complete":

```powershell
$proj = "D:\runs\my_dataset_2026-06-15"

# Counts should align (modulo any documented exclusions)
$inputs  = (Get-ChildItem "$proj\lanes" -Recurse -Filter *.tif | Where-Object { $_.Directory.FullName -notmatch '_stalled' }).Count
$detected = (Get-ChildItem "$proj\PreCFU" -Recurse -Filter *_AQuA2.mat).Count
$cfu      = (Get-ChildItem "$proj\PostCFU" -Recurse -Filter *_res_cfu.mat).Count
"Inputs: $inputs   Detected: $detected   CFU: $cfu"

# No workers still running
(Get-Process aqua_lane,cfu_lane -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Measure-Object).Count   # want 0

# Lane .err files have no content (fatal lane-level errors)
Get-ChildItem "$proj\PreCFU\_lane_logs" -Filter *.err | Where-Object {$_.Length -gt 0}

# No _ERROR.txt files (per-file failures)
Get-ChildItem "$proj\_logs\run_*\failures" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

If `detected < inputs`: check `failures\` and `_stalled\` to account for the gap.
If `cfu < detected`: rare — usually means CFU phase didn't complete; re-run with `-Split $false -Detect $false -CFU $true`.

Sanity-check the nCFU distribution (quick proxy for run quality):

```powershell
Select-String -Path "$proj\PostCFU\_lane_logs\*.log" -Pattern 'nCFU=(\d+)' |
  ForEach-Object { [int]($_.Matches.Groups[1].Value) } |
  Measure-Object -Average -Maximum -Minimum

Select-String -Path "$proj\PostCFU\_lane_logs\*.log" -Pattern 'nCFU=0\b' |
  Measure-Object | Select -Expand Count
```

Compare against the case studies in `docs/case-studies/` for what's normal for your sample type. High zero-CFU rates often mean overly strict CFU parameters or a genuinely quiet preparation.

## L. S3 sync (if not using -Upload)

If you ran the orchestrator without `-Upload $true`, do the sync manually after verification.

### L.1 — Downsize the instance first

S3 sync is network-bound, not CPU-bound. An idle r7a.24xlarge during a 2-hour upload wastes ~$12. Downsize to r7i.2xlarge — see [`03_SIZING_AND_RESIZING_GUIDE.md`](03_SIZING_AND_RESIZING_GUIDE.md) Part E.

### L.2 — Dry-run

```powershell
$proj = "D:\runs\my_dataset_2026-06-15"
$dest = "s3://bireylab-arvin-us-east-2/CalciumImagingAnalysis/AQuA2_Outputs/my_dataset_2026-06-15/"

aws s3 sync "$proj\for_upload\" $dest --dryrun | Measure-Object
```

If the dry-run reports zero files, something's wrong (`for_upload\` may not have been built — re-run with `-Consolidate $true -Split $false -Detect $false -CFU $false`).

### L.3 — Actual sync

```powershell
aws s3 sync "$proj\for_upload\" $dest --storage-class STANDARD
```

For very large transfers, use `s5cmd` (faster):

```powershell
# Install if missing:
# Invoke-WebRequest https://github.com/peak/s5cmd/releases/latest/download/s5cmd_Windows-64bit.zip -OutFile s5cmd.zip
# Expand-Archive s5cmd.zip -DestinationPath C:\tools\s5cmd
# $env:Path += ";C:\tools\s5cmd"

s5cmd --numworkers 32 sync "$proj\for_upload\" $dest
```

### L.4 — Upload the audit folder too

```powershell
aws s3 sync "$proj\_logs\" "$dest/_audit/" --storage-class STANDARD
```

Future-you and collaborators will thank present-you for this.

### L.5 — Write a per-dataset README in S3

```powershell
$readme = @"
$($proj.Split('\')[-1]) - AQuA2 Detection + CFU Outputs
======================================================
N recordings (detected): $(Get-ChildItem "$proj\PreCFU" -Recurse -Filter *_AQuA2.mat | Measure-Object | Select -Expand Count)
Magnification: 20x | Donors: <list> | Conditions: <list>

PIPELINE:
  Orchestrator: $(git -C C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\pipeline-repo describe --tags)
  AMI: Windows2025-AQuA2-Pipeline-v3 (ami-03473aa6f1cc13fbc, 2026-06-15)
  Worker exes: $(Get-Item C:\AQuA2\compiled\aqua_lane.exe | Select-Object -ExpandProperty LastWriteTime) / $(Get-Item C:\AQuA2\compiled\cfu_lane.exe | Select-Object -ExpandProperty LastWriteTime)

DETECTION PARAMETERS:
  (see archived parameters_for_batch_USED.csv in /_audit/)
  maxSize     = <value>
  frameRate   = <value>
  spatialRes  = <value>
  detectGlo   = <0|1>

EXCLUDED FILES (if any):
  <stem>  -  <reason>

Produced: $(Get-Date -Format 'yyyy-MM-dd')
"@

$readme | Set-Content "$proj\README.txt"
aws s3 cp "$proj\README.txt" "$dest/README.txt"
```

### L.6 — Verify the upload

```powershell
aws s3 ls $dest --recursive --summarize | Select-Object -Last 2
(aws s3 ls $dest --recursive | Select-String '_AQuA2\.mat').Count
(aws s3 ls $dest --recursive | Select-String '_res_cfu\.mat').Count
```

Expected counts: detected from [Section K](#k-verifying-completion).

If the sync command returned instantly and verify shows zero — see [`06_PITFALLS_AND_RECOVERY.md`](06_PITFALLS_AND_RECOVERY.md) Pitfall 9 ("instant return" pattern).

## M. Cleanup and teardown

After verifying S3 has everything:

### M.1 — Free EBS space (if you want to keep the instance)

Safe to delete once S3 sync is verified:

```powershell
$proj = "D:\runs\my_dataset_2026-06-15"

# Detection intermediate (.mat files; you have hardlinked copies in for_upload\ and they're in S3)
# But wait — these ARE the same files as in for_upload\ (hardlinks). Deleting from one location
# only removes that name; data persists if any hardlink still exists. So delete BOTH:
Remove-Item "$proj\PreCFU" -Recurse -Force
Remove-Item "$proj\PostCFU" -Recurse -Force
Remove-Item "$proj\for_upload" -Recurse -Force

# Lane TIFFs (you have them in S3 source)
Remove-Item "$proj\lanes" -Recurse -Force

# Keep _logs/ for now (small)
```

**Do not delete `D:\incoming_tiffs\`** if you didn't sync those to S3 already — they're the source data.

### M.2 — Stop or terminate the instance

For a full teardown checklist (when to keep which files, what to grab before deletion), see [`07_TEARDOWN_CHECKLIST.md`](07_TEARDOWN_CHECKLIST.md).

Quick decision tree:

- **More work on this dataset in the next few days** → Stop the instance (keeps EBS at ~$25/250GB/month, no compute cost)
- **Project complete, AMI exists for next time** → Terminate (no ongoing cost; spin up from AMI for next project)
- **Will run more, need to downsize for a long upload** → Stop, change instance type, Start (see Sizing Guide Part E)

---

## N. Next: R analysis

The data is ready. Continue to [`05_DOWNSTREAM_R_ANALYSIS.md`](05_DOWNSTREAM_R_ANALYSIS.md) for `.mat` schema, `rhdf5` integration patterns, and the canonical R scripts.

## Appendix Z: manual workflow (pre-v0.7, or debugging)

The `Run-Pipeline.ps1` orchestrator wraps these underlying scripts, all of which still exist in `powershell/` and can be called directly when:

- You need to isolate a specific phase for debugging (e.g., reproduce a Build-CFU junction failure)
- You're running on an instance without the orchestrator pulled (legacy instances)
- You need to do a redistribution recovery for a stuck lane that the auto-skip logic can't handle

The manual sequence is:

1. **`powershell\Split-IntoLanes.ps1`** — moves TIFFs from a source folder into N size-balanced lane folders
2. **`powershell\Launch-Lanes-Exe.ps1`** — launches N `aqua_lane.exe` workers, one per lane
3. **`powershell\Build-CFU-Lanes.ps1`** — creates NTFS junctions pointing to per-recording `_results/` folders, grouped into CFU lanes
4. **`powershell\Launch-CFU-Lanes.ps1`** — launches M `cfu_lane.exe` workers
5. **`powershell\Consolidate-Template.ps1`** — flattens detection output into a clean `<stem>_results/` per-recording structure
6. **`aws s3 sync`** — manual upload

Each script accepts `-WhatIfMode` style dry-runs and prints help when run with no arguments. Read the source before invoking; argument names changed between v0.6 and v0.7 series.

**Pathological-file isolation** (when one lane stays alive >>others, can't auto-skip cleanly):

1. Kill all workers: `Stop-Process -Name aqua_lane -Force`
2. List pending TIFFs in the stuck lane (no matching `_AQuA2.mat`):

   ```powershell
   $laneIn  = "<projectRoot>\lanes\lane14"
   $laneOut = "<projectRoot>\PreCFU\lane14_results"
   $done    = Get-ChildItem $laneOut -Recurse -Filter *_AQuA2.mat -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |
              ForEach-Object { $_.BaseName -replace '_AQuA2$','' }
   $pending = Get-ChildItem $laneIn -Filter *.tif | Where-Object { ($_.BaseName) -notin $done }
   "pending: $($pending.Count)"
   $pending | Select-Object Name
   ```
3. Copy each pending file into its own mini-lane:

   ```powershell
   $redRoot = "<projectRoot>\redist_in"
   Remove-Item $redRoot -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
   $N = $pending.Count
   1..$N | ForEach-Object { New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path (Join-Path $redRoot ("lane{0:D2}" -f $_)) -Force | Out-Null }
   $i = 0
   foreach ($f in $pending) {
       Copy-Item $f.FullName (Join-Path $redRoot ("lane{0:D2}" -f ($i+1)))
       $i++
   }
   ```
4. Run with the orchestrator pointed at the redist folder:

   ```powershell
   .\Run-Pipeline.ps1 `
       -OutputRoot "<projectRoot>" `
       -ProjectName "redist" `
       -InputTIFFs  "<projectRoot>\redist_in" `
       -Split       $false `
       -Lanes       $N
   ```
5. By elimination, whichever lane stays alive longest after the others complete is the pathological one — that names the bad file.

This is the same logic as B.4 in the pre-v0.7 docs, adapted to the orchestrator. The three-stage stall detection [§G](#g-three-stage-stall-detection) handles most pathological cases automatically; manual redistribution is the escape hatch when even auto-skip isn't enough.
